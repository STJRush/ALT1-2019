    <h1>Why This Car???</h1>

    
    

  

   
  

  
  The reason I like this car so much is because I have a love for vintage cars. This type of car is 40-50 years old
  and I find the structure and the history of the car very fascinating.
  <p>
  Heres some information about the car.....
  </p>
  
  
  The Land Rover was conceived by the Rover Company in 1947 during the aftermath of World War II. Before the war Rover 
  had produced luxury cars which were not in demand in the immediate post-war period and raw materials were strictly rationed 
  to those companies building construction or industrial equipment, or products that could be widely exported to earn crucial 
  foreign exchange for the country. Also, Rover's original factory in Coventry had been bombed during the war, forcing the 
  company to move into a huge "shadow factory" built just before the war in Solihull near Birmingham, previously used to 
  construct Bristol Hercules aircraft engines. This factory was now empty but starting car production there from scratch 
  would not be financially viable. Plans for a small, economical car known as the M Type were drawn up, and a few prototypes 
  made, but would be too expensive to produce.
