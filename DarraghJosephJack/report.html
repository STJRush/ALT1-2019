    <h1>ALT 1 Report</h1>
    
    <p>
      By Joseph McLoughlin, Jack Dunne & Darragh Billingsley  
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a report on our ALT 1 project 
      <P>
        For our ALT 1 project, we made a website using marvel app and uploaded the data to a firebase 
        <p>
        <h3>Our Roles </h3>
            <p>
              Joseph = Writing the Report
              <p>
                Darragh = Making the Website 
                <p>
                  Jack = Researching
        <h3>1.1 Research</h3>
        <p>Our ideas for this project was to make a interactive website that sends data to a firebase
          <p>Our website is "Rate my Dream Car". It has a photo of a 1970 Landrover Defender and a rating bar, which the numbers submitted is transfered to a firebase.This is so we know the highest ratings and the lowest ones.
        <h3>1.2 Response to Brief</h3>
        <p>For our preparation we started by making a firebase to use for our website. We used a real time database 
        <h3>2.1 Creating </h3>
        <p>We started by assigning each other different roles to do in the group. We decided that Darragh would be in charge of the code, Jack would be doing research and that I would writing up the report.
        <p>We decided that the project would be to "Rate my Dream Car", where the user of the website would be able to type in a number as a rating they would like to give the car. That data would then be sent to a database which would help us determine the highest score.
        <p>We used Glitch.com to create the website and the report. Darragh made the code for the our idea, and I began working on the report whilst Jack did research.

        <h2>3. Design and Development of Artefact</h2>
        <h3>3.1(a) The Iterative Design Process

          <h3>3.1(c) Evidence of Computational Thinking</h3>
          <p>1. Decomposition
               <p>Through through decomposition we saw that we could sort out the data collected and sort it into the highest scores in the firebase 
                 <p>2. Pattern Recognition 
                   <p>Pattern recognition is sorting the numbers from highest to lowest
                     <p>3. Abstraction 
                       <p>Abstracting by taking the numbers submitted to the website and sorting from highest to lowest in the firebase
                         <p>4. Generalisation 
                           <p>Generalising the data from highest to lowest
                             <p>5. Algorithms 
                               <p>The code that sorts the data from highest to lowest 
          <h3>3.2 Development of Artefact</h3>
          <p>User Interface
            <p>Our website has consistancy, a clear succinct display of output, and a sufficient degree of control for the user in their interaction with any software or hardware in our artefact.
              <p>Testing 
                <p>We tested the device several times over the course of our development to make sure that everything was working sufficiantly, based on our results the tests were successful.
          <h3>4. Evaluation of the Artefact</h3>
          <h4>4.1 Basic artefact features</h4>
              <p>The data is submitted 
                <p>Completed. Our project does allow the user to submit data on the website
                  <p>The data is submitted to a database.
                    <p>Completed. Our project does submit the data to a firebase.
                      <p>The device sorts the data into folders 
                        <p>Complete. Our device does sort the data from the firebase into folders
          <h3>4.2 Future Development of the Artefact</h3>
          <p>Ways we could improve in the future could be if we have more time we could've developed a more advanced program with extra features, including displaying the highest and lowest scores on the website and show the percentage of which numbers between 1 and 10 that people chose, and also a more complex design of the website.
