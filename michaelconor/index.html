    <h1>ATL 1 Report</h1>
    
    <p>
    By Michael and conor <a href="https://glitch.com"></a>
    </p> This is our ATL 1 project, 
    <h3>
      Our roles
      
    
   </h3>
    Michael/conor = website,database,code
     <h3>
       1.1 Research
    </h3>
      We had many different ideas but we chose this one cause you need food in your everyday life food is something that provides nutrients, energy for activity, growth, and all functions of the body such as breathing, digesting food, and keeping warm; materials for the growth and repair of the body, and for keeping the immune system healthy.
    
    <h3>
      1.2 Response to the Brief 
    </h3>
    The way we got ready for this project we sat down and talked and planned out who was going to do what. and we set taks each day so that everyone in the group is working.
    <h3>
     
    <h3>
      
      </h3>
    we created this project by using the marvel website. The Marvel app is an app that allows you to design and create prototypes of your own apps. It is a great way to use your imagination and create your own apps. Best of all, you can start using it for free.
     <h3>
       3.1 (a) The iterative design process

      <h3>
        3.1 (c) Evidence of Computational Thinking
      
      </h3>
       Through Decomposition, we broke down the operation of the desgin prcoess into three basic parts: 1. It takes the rating (input), 2. Compares the input to certain ratings, 3. we try to find the average ratings
      <h3>
      3.2 Development of the Artefact </h3>
      <h3>
        User Interface Design
      </h3>
      we chose a gesture control system because it was the best choice for the group
      <h3>
        Testing
      </h3>
      We tested the firebase with 3 people in our sample audience and based on the feedback we got really good food rating
      <h3>
      4. Evaluation of the artefact
      </h3>
      
Basic Artefact Features

The temperature is measured

Completed. Our project does measure the temperature using internal temperature sensors.


The current temperature is displayed to the user.

Completed. Our project shows the temperature as scrolling text every 10 seconds.

The device shows an alert/notification when a certain temperature is reached.

Incomplete. Our project does not yet measure the temperature using internal temperature sensors as we ran out of time before adding this feature.
